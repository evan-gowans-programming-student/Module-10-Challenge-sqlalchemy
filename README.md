Module 10: Climate Data Analysis with SQLAlchemy and Flask
Overview
In this project, we performed a comprehensive climate data analysis for a vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. Using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask, we explored historical climate data stored in an SQLite database, extracted actionable insights, and created a user-friendly API to share our findings. The project is divided into two parts: data analysis and API development.

Key Components
Part 1: Climate Data Analysis
We used SQLAlchemy ORM to query and analyze the climate data stored in the hawaii.sqlite database. The dataset included tables for weather measurements (measurement) and weather stations (station). Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and datetime, we explored precipitation trends, temperature data, and station activity.

Steps in Analysis
Database Setup:

Connected to the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy’s create_engine.

Reflected tables (measurement and station) into Python classes with SQLAlchemy Automap.

Established a session to interact with the database.

Precipitation Analysis:

Queried precipitation data for the 12 months preceding the most recent date in the dataset (2017-08-23).

Plotted a bar chart to visualize daily precipitation levels.

Printed descriptive statistics for the precipitation data using Pandas.

Station Analysis:

Counted the total number of weather stations (9 stations).

Determined the most active station (USC00519281) by observation count.

Calculated the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures recorded by the most active station.

Queried temperature observations (TOBS) for the most active station over the last 12 months.

Visualized the temperature data as a histogram with 12 bins.

Part 2: Flask API Development
We built a Flask API to expose our climate data analysis as user-friendly routes. The API enables users to access precipitation and temperature data dynamically based on date ranges.

Available Routes
/:

Homepage listing all available routes.

/api/v1.0/precipitation:

Returns a JSON dictionary of precipitation data for the last year, where date is the key and prcp (precipitation) is the value.

/api/v1.0/stations:

Returns a JSON list of all station IDs in the dataset.

/api/v1.0/tobs:

Returns a JSON list of temperature observations (TOBS) for the most active station over the last year.

/api/v1.0/<start>:

Accepts a start date (YYYY-MM-DD).

Returns a JSON dictionary with the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for all dates on and after the start date.

/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>:

Accepts a start and end date (YYYY-MM-DD).

Returns a JSON dictionary with the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for the date range specified.

Development Highlights
Flask is used to set up API routes, which handle dynamic queries to the SQLite database.

SQLAlchemy ORM manages database interactions, ensuring efficient and secure data retrieval.

JSON responses provide clean and structured data output for API consumers.

Key Learnings
This project introduced several concepts and skills:

SQLAlchemy ORM: Mapping database tables to Python classes and performing queries using SQL-like syntax.

Data Analysis: Analyzing and visualizing data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and datetime.

RESTful API Design: Developing a Flask API with multiple routes to handle static and dynamic user requests.

JSON: Formatting data into JSON objects for web consumption.
